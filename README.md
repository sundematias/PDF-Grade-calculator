# PDF-Grade-calculator
Calculating average grade by parsing a PDF, instead of doing it manually. Made for NTNU Grade transcripts, but should work for any PDF made from Vitnem√•lsportalen.

More details, as well as deployment at https://pdf-grade-calculator.streamlit.app/

There is a Jupyter Notebook that you can download, if you do not want to upload your transcript.
